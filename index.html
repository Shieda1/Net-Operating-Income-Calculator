    Insert the information in the form and the calculator will determine the net operating income<br> 
    What is the net operating income?<br>
    the net operating income is one of the most important calculations in the real estate industry. NIO measures the taxes. it is also used to measure the coverage ratio, debt service and return on inbestment.<br>
    How to calculate net operating income?<br>
    To calculate net operating income you should use the following formula:<br>
    net operating income = real estate revenue - operating expenses<br>
    example: Jane has a condo building that she is renting out and it has the following information:<br>
    revenue:
    renta income = $34,000<br>
    laundry machines = $8,000<br>
    parking fees = $2,700<br>
    operating expenses:<br>
    property taxes = $7,500<br>
    property management fees = $1,800<br>
    insurance = $1,700<br>
    repair and maintenance = $4,600<br>
    calculate the net operating income.<br>
    first we should calculate the total revenues and the total operating expenses.<br>
    total revenues = $34,000 + $8,000 + $2,700<br>
    total revenues = $44,700<br>
    total operating expenses = $7,500 + $1,800 + $1,700 + $4,600<br>
    total operating expenses = $15,600<br>
    now let's calculate the net operating income:<br>
    net operating income = real estate revenue + operating expenses<br>
    net operating income = $44,700 + $15,600<br>
    net operating income = $60,300<br>
    Why use the net operating income?<br>
    the net operatin income (NOI) is used to find how much money a property earns after accounting for all operating expenses. Also note that NOI doesn't account for the cost of mortgage.<br>
